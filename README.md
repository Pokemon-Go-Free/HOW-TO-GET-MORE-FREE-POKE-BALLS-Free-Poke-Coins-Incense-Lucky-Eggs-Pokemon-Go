Poke Balls are essential for catching Pokemon in *Pokemon Go*. Having an abundance of these can make all the difference in your gameplay, especially when you come across rare or hard-to-catch Pokemon. Here are the best ways to stock up on Poke Balls without spending real money:

#### a. **Spin PokÃ©Stops and Gyms**
One of the easiest and most reliable ways to get more Poke Balls is by visiting nearby PokÃ©Stops and Gyms. Every time you spin the disk at a PokÃ©Stop or Gym, you have a chance of receiving Poke Balls as a reward. If youâ€™re in a densely populated area, there are typically lots of PokÃ©Stops and Gyms to visit.

#### b. **Daily Free Box**
Niantic, the developer of *Pokemon Go*, offers a free daily box that players can claim. This box may contain various items, including Poke Balls. While the contents of the box vary, itâ€™s always a good idea to log in every day and grab your free items!

#### c. **Special Events**
From time to time, Niantic hosts special events and community days that give out free Poke Balls as part of their rewards. Keep an eye on in-game notifications and official *Pokemon Go* social media channels to stay up-to-date with these events.

#### d. **Field Research Tasks**
Completing field research tasks and special research quests can earn you rewards like Poke Balls. These tasks often require you to catch specific Pokemon or complete certain actions, but the rewards are worth the effort.

#### e. **Lucky Friends Gifts**
When you reach the status of "Lucky Friends" with another player, you can exchange gifts that sometimes contain Poke Balls, Incense, and other items. This adds an extra level of excitement to the game, as you can exchange gifts with friends and gain a variety of useful items.

### 2. **How to Get Free Poke Coins in Pokemon Go**

Poke Coins are the premium currency in *Pokemon Go*. They allow you to purchase various items, including Poke Balls, Incense, and Lucky Eggs. While you can purchase Poke Coins with real money, there are also ways to earn them for free. Here's how:

#### a. **Defend Gyms**
One of the best ways to earn Poke Coins for free is by defending a Gym. If you place a Pokemon in a Gym, you can earn Poke Coins every 10 minutes your Pokemon is occupying the Gym, up to a maximum of 50 coins per day. To maximize your Poke Coins, try placing your strongest Pokemon in a Gym that is difficult for other players to take down.

#### b. **Daily Free Poke Coins**
Niantic offers a daily free coin bonus for players who complete certain tasks. While this amount is usually small (around 1â€“5 Poke Coins), itâ€™s a good starting point if youâ€™re looking to collect Poke Coins without spending money.

#### c. **Special Promotions and Events**
Keep an eye out for special promotions, in-game events, or collaborations that may reward you with free Poke Coins. Niantic often releases limited-time events that give players opportunities to earn Poke Coins by completing specific challenges.

#### d. **Use Poke Coin Free Apps and Websites**
Some websites and apps offer the opportunity to earn Poke Coins by completing tasks or surveys. While these apps may require some time and effort, they can be an additional source for earning free Poke Coins. Always make sure to research and verify these apps before using them.

### 3. **How to Get Free Incense in Pokemon Go**

Incense is an item that attracts wild Pokemon to your location, making it much easier to catch rare or hard-to-find Pokemon. If youâ€™re looking to get more Incense for free, here are some ways to do so:

#### a. **Daily Free Box**
The daily free box in *Pokemon Go* sometimes contains Incense as a reward. Even though this isnâ€™t guaranteed, itâ€™s worth checking the box every day to see if Incense is included.

#### b. **Special Events**
Niantic frequently runs events that offer Incense as part of their rewards. During certain events, Incense is also used to increase the spawn rate of specific Pokemon, so it's a great time to stock up on it. Be sure to keep an eye on the official *Pokemon Go* channels for event details.

#### c. **Research Tasks**
As with Poke Balls, completing research tasks can also reward you with Incense. Make sure to check your list of available research tasks to see if any provide this valuable resource.

#### d. **Purchase via Poke Coins**
While you can get Incense for free, you can also purchase it directly from the shop using Poke Coins if you need more.

### 4. **How to Get Free Lucky Eggs in Pokemon Go**

Lucky Eggs are powerful items that double the XP you earn for a limited time. They are especially useful for leveling up quickly, especially during events or when evolving Pokemon. Here are some ways to get more free Lucky Eggs:

#### a. **Level Up Rewards**
When you reach certain trainer levels, *Pokemon Go* rewards you with items like Lucky Eggs. Be sure to claim your level-up rewards and check for any Lucky Eggs among the items.

#### b. **Special Research and Tasks**
Similar to Poke Balls and Incense, completing special research or field research tasks can reward you with Lucky Eggs. Pay attention to the various research tasks available and see if any offer Lucky Eggs as a reward.

#### c. **PokÃ©mon Go Events**
Niantic often hosts special events in which Lucky Eggs are given as rewards. Participating in these events not only grants you Lucky Eggs, but it also provides increased XP, making them perfect for leveling up quickly.
